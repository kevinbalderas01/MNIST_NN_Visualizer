# MNIST_NN_Visualizer
This is a Neural Network visualizer for the MNIST dataset. Made with Flask, Streamlit and Python.<br>
There are two files: ml_server.py and app.py. <br>
The first is the server made in Flask, which take care of all the model representation.<br>
Then the app.py is the Streamlit App in order to make the Visualizer.<br>
The jupyter notebook shows all the model process with tensorflow.<br>
Let's see the following image, where the app.py is running at the same time that ml_server.py
